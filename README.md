This web application is designed as an aid for anyone planning to travel to an unfamiliar city within their near future. The Dream Your Vacation App combines two of the most important aspects of recreational travel that a user may take into consideration when deciding what to pack as well as what activities they may want to engage in while on their stay. 

The landing page prompts the user with a modal that instructs the user on how to use the app and what information will be presented to the user upon search of their desired destination. The application has a search bar that takes an input of a city. Once the search button is clicked, the current weather and future weather forecasts for the next 7 days populate along the top of the application. A list of attractions also populates under the weather dashboard. These 10 attractions are recreational activities populated from a Trip Advisor API for the users exploration. 

The weather data that is populated on the screen is being called from an online API via AJAX. All of this data as well as well as the attractions data is appended onto the screen dynamically through logical loops that include HTML and Javascript. This logic is what populates the HTML elements into cards in which the user can see. The Dream Your Vacation utilizes Javascript, CSS, AJAX, Bootstrap and jQuery technologies. The ultimate purpose of this application is to provide the convenience of weather and activities for a user that is traveling within the near furture for the purpose of helping them plan out their perfect vacation.
